        Design is evolving from physical artifacts to human experience:
        perception (senses), cognition (mind), emotion (heart), and action
        (body). The future of design and architecture may be in the integration
        of the separate disciplines to learn how interconnected systems work and
        model the built environment to imitate the processes of living
        organisms.
